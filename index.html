          Hello, I am Chandrika. I am an enthusiast App/Web Developer and UI/UX Designer. I'm currently persueing B.Tech degree in Computer Science Engineering from Shri Vaishnav Vidhyapeeth Vishwavidhyalaya, Indore.
          <br><br>I've spent the past few years diving deep into the world of programming, focusing particularly on web development. From crafting intuitive user interfaces to bringing functionality to life through code, I find immense joy in the creative process of building web applications. My journey has equipped me with a solid foundation in languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm constantly exploring new frameworks and technologies to expand my skill set.<br><br>
          Beyond the digital realm, you'll often find me outdoors, soaking up the thrill of field sports. Whether it's the strategy of swimming, or the precision of badminton, I thrive on the adrenaline and teamwork that these sports offer.
          As I navigate through the final stretch of my academic journey, I'm eagerly seeking opportunities to merge my technical expertise
